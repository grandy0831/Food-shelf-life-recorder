Flutter Application Name - SeatMap

GitHub Repository - [https://github.com/grandy0831/SeatMap](https://github.com/grandy0831/SeatMap)

## Introduction to Application

SeatMap is a mobile application designed to optimise learning spaces on campus. It is primarily designed to help students and staff quickly find available seats in various educational buildings at UCL, thereby improving learning efficiency and space utilisation. It accurately displays the current number of seats available in each classroom by monitoring seat occupancy in real time.

The app integrates with UCL's Live Data API to collect data from pressure sensors placed under each seat to monitor its status. This feature is particularly useful for students who need to find an available seat, especially during peak hours in the library or study room. SeatMap has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows users to quickly check the occupancy status of all educational buildings, clearly showing which seats are available.

In addition to real-time seat monitoring, SeatMap also allows users to mark frequently used buildings as favourites for faster access to these locations for future use. SeatMap not only simplifies the process of finding available study space, but also helps to effectively manage and optimise the use of campus resources, making it an ideal tool for students and teachers in their daily learning and teaching activities.
